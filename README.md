## making the travel-fly landing page responsive/adaptive 

<br/>
<br/>

For this homework assignment, we were tasked with adapting the travel-fly landing page created in homework-three to be responsive to browser scaling. We utilized tools such as media queries and CSS code that is forgiving towards a browser that is scaling down, for example max-width and percentage values. This required minor tweaks to the original structure of the landing page, i.e. combining items on the same line into a singluar div "wrapper".

Test the scaling feature by dragging the side of your browser in to condense the website!
