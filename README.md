## creating the about page and joining it with the landingpage 

<br/>
<br/>

For this homework assignment, we were given the task of creating and adding the About page to our website/original landing page. There weren't many new code concepts we needed to implement this week but we did spend a lot of time on the cloning of code repositories. Cloning can help a group of programmers prioritize consistent use of dependensies and packages as well as allow for easy iteration on previous projects.
